# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
Loans are an integral part of modern society. It presents opportunities and poses a serious challenge for banks. It creates revenues with interest rate generated, and other hand, people default payment, thus, creates a loss of revenues. However, machine learning can be used to analyze large set of data to predict risk and inform the decision to approve loan application or reject it. 
Usually, banks traditionally rely on income, credit scores and collateral assest to asses the lending risk. The cahleenge of this is that, many data can be left out which could have aid the lending decisions.
In this project, I used the credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, for the analysis. I used Python and Scikit-learn libraries to build algorthms and predict credit risk. I finally, evaluate the following machine learning models:
- Naive Random Oversampling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Undersampling
- SMOTEENN
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier.

I then compared their strengths and weaknesses to assess how well each models works to classify and predict the risks.
