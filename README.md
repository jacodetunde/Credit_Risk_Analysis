# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
Loans are integral part of modern society, it present opportunities and pose serious challenge for the bankers.
It creates revenues with interest rate generated and other hand people default payment thus, creates loss of revenues. 
However, machine learning can be used to analyze risk by analyzing large set of data to predict risk in order to decide whether to approve loan application or reject it.
In this project, I used the credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company for the analysis.
 I used Python and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate the following machine learning models:
 - Naive Random Oversampling
 - SMOTE Oversampling
 - Undersampling
 - SMOTEENN
 - Balanced Random Forest Classifier
 - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
 to predict credit risk. I then compared thier strength and weakness to asses how well each models works in classifying and predicting the risks.
